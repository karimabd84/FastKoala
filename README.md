# Fast Koala
Enables build-time config transforms for various project types including web apps, with future plans to also ease config name management and add MSBuild scripts (Imports directives to custom .targets files) to a project.

Current status: Initial commit performs basic functionality for empty web sites that need build-time transformations.

    Web.config
    Web.Debug.config
    Web.Release.config
    
.. become ..

    App_Config\Web.Base.config
    App_Config\Web.Debug.config
    App_Config\Web.Release.config
  
and Web.config at project root becomes transient (and should never be added to source control).

Initial commit also supports basic class libraries (which can have config files) and Windows apps (other than ClickOnce apps) that need to transform out to the bin\Debug or bin\Release directory as AssemblyName.exe.config.

In all cases, to use, right-click on the project node in Solution Explorer and choose "Enable build-time transformations"

This project *does not* use automated unit tests. :(

### How it works ###

This Visual Studio extension will modify your project by injecting a custom MSBuild target that invokes the TransformXml task with the custom config paths as parameters. It does not use NuGet and it does not import an external .targets file in order to support build-time transformations--at least, not at this time, these behaviors might be added down the road but there are several reasons to avoid any of that.
